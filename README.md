# Clean Code Development
### 1.Consistent naming convention
 Throughout coding, naming scheme of camel case is used for both variables and functions. Moreover, for immutable/final variables all-upper-casing scheme is used.
 
### 2.Modularity

Source code has been divided into two modules. Module "Analyzer" is responsible for object recognition tasks, while module "Router" is responsible for routing of incoming and outgoing rest API requests.

### 3. Configure Data at Higher Level
All configurable data (for example: Directory names, paths), have been placed at higher level, making tweaking of values easier for the purpose of debugging.

# Merics
 In FlightPricePrediction I have used two Metrics which is Sonarcloud and Codacy
 In Scrappy I have used Two Matrices which is Sonarcloud and Codacy.

SonarCloud is a cloud service offered by SonarSource and based on SonarQube. SonarQube is a widely adopted open source platform to inspect continuously the quality of source code and detect bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in more than 20 different languages.

Codacy Automatically identify issues through static code review analysis. Therefore we can be notified on security issues, code coverage, code duplication, and code complexity in every commit and pull request, directly from your current workflow.
