# Clean Code Development
### 1.Consistent naming convention
 Throughout coding, naming scheme of camel case is used for both variables and functions. Moreover, for immutable/final variables all-upper-casing scheme is used.
 
### 2.Modularity

Source code has been divided into two modules. Module "Analyzer" is responsible for object recognition tasks, while module "Router" is responsible for routing of incoming and outgoing rest API requests.
